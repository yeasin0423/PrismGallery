# Prism Gallery

A fast, private photo and video gallery for Android, with four complete design styles and smooth animations.
It works entirely offline: no internet permission, no ads, no tracking, no account.

Prism Gallery is made for:

- custom ROMs that ship without a usable gallery app,
- phones whose only gallery is a cloud photo app,
- anyone who wants a smooth, good-looking gallery that keeps their photos private.

## Features

- **Four design styles** with their own layouts and animations, inspired by iOS (Liquid Glass), Samsung One UI,
  Xiaomi HyperOS and Google Gemini
- Photos, videos and GIFs from internal storage and the SD card
- Albums: create, rename, hide, sub-albums, move media between albums, move whole albums between internal storage
  and SD card
- Favorites and trash
- Deep zoom, readable even on huge photos and very long scroll screenshots
- Editor: crop, rotate and mirror photos and videos (saved as a copy)
- Storage overview for internal storage and SD card
- Open photos and videos from other apps ("Open with")
- English and German
- Adjustable graphics quality for older or low-memory devices

## Privacy

Prism Gallery has no internet permission, so it cannot send anything anywhere. It only asks for access to your
photos and videos. Settings stay on your device.

## Requirements

Android 10 (API 29) or newer.

## Download

- **GitHub Releases:** https://github.com/Soretake/PrismGallery/releases
- **F-Droid:** coming soon

### Verifying the APK

APKs from GitHub Releases are signed with this certificate (SHA-256):

```
A5:66:D9:9F:38:36:C3:6E:77:BE:C4:EA:44:62:AC:8F:E6:FF:30:9F:67:F1:64:97:F0:87:F8:D0:3D:9E:EF:9F
```

You can check it with `apksigner verify --print-certs app-release.apk`, or let
[AppVerifier](https://github.com/soupslurpr/AppVerifier) or [Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium) do it.
The build is reproducible: F-Droid builds the app from source and publishes the APK signed with this same key, so
installs from F-Droid and from GitHub can update each other.

## Building

Requirements: JDK 17 and the Android SDK (compile SDK 34).

```sh
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

The APK is written to `app/build/outputs/apk/release/`. Without a signing key the release APK is unsigned.
To sign it, create a `keystore.properties` file in the project root (it is git-ignored and must never be committed):

```properties
storeFile=/path/to/your-release-key.jks
storePassword=...
keyAlias=...
keyPassword=...
```
